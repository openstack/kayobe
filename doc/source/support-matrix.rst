Supported Operating Systems
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Kayobe supports the following host Operating Systems (OS):

* Rocky Linux 9 (since Zed 13.0.0 release)
* Ubuntu Jammy 22.04 (since Zed 13.0.0 release)
* Ubuntu Noble 24.04 (since Caracal 16.7.0 release)

In addition to that CentOS Stream 9 host OS is functional, but not officially
supported. Kolla does not publish CentOS Stream 9 images to Docker Hub/Quay.io,
therefore users need to build them by themselves.

.. note::

   CentOS Stream 8 is no longer supported as a host OS. The Yoga release
   supports both CentOS Stream 8 and 9, and provides a route for migration.

   Rocky Linux 8 is no longer supported as a host OS. The Yoga release supports
   both Rocky Linux 8 and 9, and provides a route for migration.
