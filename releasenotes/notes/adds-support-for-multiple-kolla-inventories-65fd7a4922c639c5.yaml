    Kolla Ansible inventories in the Kayobe configuration are now passed
    through without modification.  Previously, only ``group_vars`` were passed
    through.  When using multiple environments, the Kolla inventory from the
    base configuration layer **and** the Kolla inventory from the Kayobe
    environment layer will be passed through. The inventory from the
    environment takes precedence over the inventory from the base layer. This
    allows you to put any shared configuration in the base layer.
upgrade:
  - |
    As Kolla Ansible inventories are now passed through without modification,
    the inventory directory in Kayobe configuration
    (``etc/kayobe/kolla/inventory/``) must be a valid Ansible inventory,
    although ``*.j2`` files used as Kolla Ansible inventory templates are
    ignored. For cases where only ``group_vars`` or ``hosts_vars`` are
    required, a blank inventory file in the same directory may be used.

    It is no longer possible to create an environment named ``kayobe``. This
    is reserved for internal use.
