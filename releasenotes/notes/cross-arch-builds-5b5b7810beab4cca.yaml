    The ``kolla_base_arch`` variable has been introduced, allowing users
    to specify the architecture for base container images. This supports
    cross-architecture builds, enabling the building of images for
    architectures different from the host machine (e.g., building
    ``aarch64`` images on an ``x86_64`` machine).

    By default, ``kolla_base_arch`` is set to the detected architecture
    (``{{ ansible_facts.architecture }}``). However, when ``kolla_base_arch``
    differs from the host architecture, the ``multiarch/qemu-user-static``
    image is used to facilitate cross-arch builds.
