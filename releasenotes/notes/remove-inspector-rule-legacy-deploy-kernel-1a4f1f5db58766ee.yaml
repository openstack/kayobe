upgrade:
  - |
    Removes the Bifrost introspection rule that was updating the deploy kernel
    location from the legacy ``ipa.vmlinuz`` path to the new ``ipa.kernel``
    path. If this migration has not yet been applied, update the deployment
    kernel location manually with:

    ``OS_CLOUD=bifrost baremetal node set --driver-info deploy_kernel=<http://url/to/ipa.kernel> $NODE_UUID_OR_NAME``

    This is only relevant for deployments with nodes discovered with the
    OpenStack Train release or earlier.
