upgrade:
  - |
    The inspection_store container has been removed since it was tied to the
    standalone Ironic Inspector implementation and support for deploying that
    service has been dropped. The new inspection implemenation built into
    Ironic stores a similar set of data in the database.  Prior to upgrading,
    you may wish to dump any data with the ``kayobe overcloud introspection data
    save`` command. After the upgrade the container should be manually removed
    from the first controller using either ``docker stop inspection store &&
    docker rm inspection_store`` or ``sudo podman stop inspection_store && sudo
    podman rm inspection_store``
