    The ``openstacksdk_upper_constraints_file`` variable now defaults to the
    value of ``pip_upper_constraints_file``. Set
    ``openstacksdk_upper_constraints_file`` to
    ``"https://releases.openstack.org/constraints/upper/{{ openstack_release
    }}"`` if you want to retain existing behaviour.
