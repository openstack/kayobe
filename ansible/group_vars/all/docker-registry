# Docker registry configuration.

# Whether a docker registry is enabled.
docker_registry_enabled: False

# Dict of environment variables to provide to the docker registry container.
# This allows to configure the registry by overriding specific configuration
# options, as described at https://docs.docker.com/registry/configuration/
# For example, the registry can be configured as a pull through cache to Docker
# Hub by setting REGISTRY_PROXY_REMOTEURL to "https://registry-1.docker.io".
# Note that it is not possible to push to a registry configured as a
# pull through cache.
docker_registry_env: {}

# The port on which the docker registry server should listen.
# NOTE: This is set to 4000 rather than the default of 5000 to avoid clashing
#       with keystone.
docker_registry_port: 4000

# Name or path to use as the volume for the docker registry.
